Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
software engineering is a branch of computer science that applies engineering principles and tools in order to develop and maintain a high quality software product. This field is important because it has powered and bring forth solutions to various aspects of modern life like creating platform that aid for commerce, communications,entertainment etc.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1) The establishment of programming languages whcih can now use to write code in order to develop programs , the establish of software engineering as a cousre that teaches one on how to create code and lastly it provides structured method that can be used to create software.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
The software Development Lifecycle (SLDC) is recurrent process often revolving amongst these sub processes such as Requirements, Design, Implementation/Development, Testing, Deployment, Maintenance.
a) Requirement- is the process that involves soughting out what user needs and requires so as to get a targeted goals for which you want to develop a software.
b)Design- is the process in which you describe and plan how the software will looks and how different parts would work together.
c)Implementation/Development-is the process where the actual coding takes place, it involves putting the plan to action.
d)Testing- is a procedure carried to ensure that the software meets requirements and user needs as well as effective functioning.
e)Deployment- involves making the software available for user to use them.
f)Maintenance- is the continuous process that involves checking and updating software products by adding new features.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Comparism between the Waterfall and Agile method: They both involves sequential approach step by step as follow in the software development Life cycle. 
Contrast: The Waterfall method is often and mostly a wholsome method that involves creating the entire software at once before you think of adding changes while maintaining the software product whereas the Agile method is a method deployed to start up a software and deploy it right away and often responds to changes as changes will be made as the software is being operated and it's more flexible between user and software developers.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developers are the ones that write the code and implement the plan for a software.
Quality Assurance Engineers work by running test so as to ensure effective working of the software product.
project manager is the one who oversee the entire process and makes sure it's done with in the targeted time and budget.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) are tools deployed by software engineers to write code and implement the projects; detecting bugs and fixing them.
Version Control Systems(VCS) are tools used mainly in the maintenance stage of the SDLC as it involves adding new features to a software product. It often tells who makes the version and at what time illustrating the progress betweent different version of a software product.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Change in the requirements, that occurs as a result of change in plan goals while project is on going.
Targeted Deadline: The time specified for a project to be done with often plays a crucial role in the low quality of a software product, as software developers will be in rush to complete the project before that time.
Technical debt often incurred in a software product when the developer didn't follow a straight procedure and takes shortcuts to complete task.
One effective way of solving this is effective communication with others developers enhancing team work; deploying the agile method and prioritizing certain task that needs to be done before other smaller tasks.
Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit Testing is the act of testing individual part of a software system.
Integration Testing is the act of testing the interaction between different parts of the system.
system testing is the process of testing the entire ststem as a whole.
Acceptance testing involves testing the software system to ensure it meets required standards.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Promt Engineering is a discipline that involves crafting query and instruction in a more unique and effective way to get the best respone from an AI assistant.It is important in the interaction with AI models cause it reduces complexity and it's specific im giving instructions and questions to an AI model.
Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
What is Integration?-vague question 
what is Integration in calculus?-consie promt 
Looking at these two promts ths first prompt 'what is integration?' is vague as the word integration is use in different disciplines and thus it implies different context.Ex: Integration in Mathematics specifically calculus involves finding the anti derivative of a function which  is more concise to our effective promt question. well generalizing it, will give us respone like putting part of a system together to ensure they work together. So; it was meedful to specify the question by asking 'what is integration in calculus?'.
